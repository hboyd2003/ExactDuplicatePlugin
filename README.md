# Exact Duplicate Plugin for Musicbrainz Picard
This is a simple plugin for MusicBrainz Picard music tagging software.
The plugin looks to see if a album already exists in your library.

It works by running your naming script and looking for file conflicts, if a file conflict is found it adds an error to the album marking it red. Additionally it imports the conflicting files for you to view.
